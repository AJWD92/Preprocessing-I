        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a full time student at Lambda. I am currenlty studying Full Stack
          Web Development. Before Lambda I was self-taught for 2 years. Where I
          studied HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, Node.js, Python, C#, and C++. I
          am a very motivated pesron who loves to explore, and learn new things.
          I have a passion for finding and fixing problems to better understand
          how they work. I am very team, and goal oriented. I do not let
          problems stop me instead I power through them till I find my solution.
          I have no problems asking for help when I need it, or doing research
          to find my answer. I feel as if I would be a perfect fit at any
          company I work for. As I am very fluid, and adaptive. A team player
          who won't let a problem back me down from completing the task at hand.

              I have studied HTML at Lambda. Where they taught us how to use

              are ADA compliant.
